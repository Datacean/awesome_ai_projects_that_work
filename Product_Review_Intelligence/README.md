# üéØ Product Review Intelligence System

AI-powered system to automatically analyze product reviews for sentiment, topics, and urgency using Hugging Face transformers and FastAPI.

## What It Does

- **üòäüòû Sentiment Analysis**: Detects if reviews are positive or negative
- **üè∑Ô∏è Topic Detection**: Identifies what customers talk about (quality, shipping, price, etc.)
- **‚ö° Urgency Detection**: Flags reviews that need immediate attention
- **üöÄ REST API**: Easy integration with any application

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the API

```bash
python api.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000` with interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
