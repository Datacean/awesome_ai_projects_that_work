There are a lot of AI projects out there. The focus of this repo is to make sure that **the AI projects listed here work.**

## Projects

| Project | Description | Stack |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| [A Gentle Introduction to Transfer Learning](A_Gentle_Introduction_to_Transfer_Learning/) | Compare finetuning vs freeze-and-train strategies across 4 image datasets (Hymenoptera, Simpsons, Dogs vs Cats, Caltech 256) in both color and grayscale. | PyTorch, ResNet, torchvision |
| [Gradient Boosting Decision Trees](Grandient_Boosting_Decision_Trees/) | Guide to tree-based ML: Decision Trees, GBDT, and Random Forests with visualization and parameter tuning. | scikit-learn, LightGBM, Graphviz |
| [Intro to CNNs](Intro_To_CNNs/) | Image convolution filters (sharpening, edge detection) and a LeNet CNN trained on MNIST digits. | PyTorch, OpenCV |
| [Product Review Intelligence](Product_Review_Intelligence/) | REST API that analyzes product reviews for sentiment, topics, and urgency using zero-shot classification. | Hugging Face, FastAPI, DistilBERT, BART |
